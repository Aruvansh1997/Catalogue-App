The Catalogue project tells us about the top 10 or top 25 paid and free apps from the ios store.

It uses the RSS feed available on the apple site.
It fetches and converts the xml code into useful information that
in turn helps us to get the top apps list in the container.

Also the code is optimized so that the data is not fetched everytime if the information is constant.
